The public keyword is first of all a "access modifier", that means that it can specify how to access classes, methods and fields/instance variables
We already know we can use the .(dot) operator to access fields/instance variables and methods of classes and objects, that can be changed though.
With the public access modifier we set the access level is basically set to "everywhere". That means that everything that is public can be accessed
inside a class, outside a class, inside the package and outside the package

The private keyword is like the public keyword, an access modifier. If we use private, the access level is only inside the class. Everything that is
private can not be accessed from outside the class.

Static is a "Non-access modifier", so when we use the static keyword, we can access fields/instance variables and methods using the class name.
An example is looking at the "System.out" command, here we look at the "out" part, "out" is a static field of "System".
