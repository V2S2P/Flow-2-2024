//A class is a blueprint to create an object, and an object is an instance of a class

    //When variables are in a class, they are called instance variables

    void method1(/*parameters*/){

    }
    int method2(/*parameters*/){
        //body of method
    //As this method is of type int, it has to return the same datatype, so return and then a number because it's an int
